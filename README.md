# Injury Prevention in Sports Analytics
Injury prevention in sports requires a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including the type of sport, playing surface, and individual player characteristics.
# Use Case
This project uses datasets from baseball and football games to demonstrate the application of sports analytics in injury prevention for team sports.

# Dataset
1. _**National Football Data:**_
   Purpose: The dataset combines injury records and player details to offer insights into injury causes, player behavior, game environment, and positional dynamics.
 **Result: Implement exploratory Data Analytics and develop a  machine learning model based on this Dataset**
2. _**EPL Baseball Data:**_
   Injury Details: Captures information on player injuries.
   Hitter/Pitcher: Distinguishes between hitter and pitcher.
   Duration Analysis: Analyze recovery duration and short/long-term injuries.
   Position and Team: Study the relation between position, team, and injuries.
 **Result: Developed a Dynamic Visualization comprising most injury factors and their aftermath**
