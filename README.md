# Injury Prevention in Sports Analytics
Injury prevention in sports requires a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including the type of sport, playing surface, and individual player characteristics.


# Draft a 4-step framework to solve the problem

# Use Case
This project uses datasets from baseball and football games to demonstrate the application of sports analytics in injury prevention for team sports.

# Dataset
1. _**National Football Data:**_
   Purpose: The dataset combines injury records and player details to offer insights into injury causes, player behavior, game environment, and positional dynamics.
 **Result: Implement exploratory Data Analytics and develop a  machine learning model based on this Dataset**
2. _**EPL Baseball Data:**_
   Injury Details: Captures information on player injuries.
  Hitter/Pitcher: Distinguishes between hitter and pitcher.
  Duration Analysis: Analyze recovery duration and short/long-term injuries.
  Position and Team: Study the relation between position, team, and injuries.
 **Result: Developed a Dynamic Visualization comprising most injury factors and their aftermath**

# Conclusion
Incorporating injury records and player details, our approach provides comprehensive insights into player injuries, encompassing causes, behavior, environment, and positions. By constructing a predictive model, we predict risk factors that helps in safeguarding players' well-being and enhance overall game dynamics
